# Forecasting-the-Indian-Index-of-Industrial-Production
This repository contains code for forecasting the Indian Index of Industrial Production (IIP) using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and SVR (Support Vector Regression) models. The IIP is an important economic indicator that measures the performance of various industrial sectors in India.

# Introduction
Forecasting the IIP is crucial for policymakers, economists, and investors to make informed decisions about economic trends and industrial performance. This project explores the use of machine learning techniques, specifically LSTM and SVR, to predict the future values of the IIP.

# Data
The data used in this project consists of historical IIP values along with relevant economic indicators and time series features.

# Models
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks. In this project, we utilize LSTM to capture the temporal dependencies in the IIP time series data and make accurate forecasts.

# Support Vector Regression (SVR)
SVR is a supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It works by mapping input data to a high-dimensional feature space and finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the different classes in that space. In this project, SVR is applied to forecast the IIP values based on historical data and relevant features.

# Results
The performance of the LSTM and SVR models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the SVR and LSTM files uploaded.
